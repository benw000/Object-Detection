details

design principles:
-small scale
-uses lightweight models with quick training time
-quick end-to-end demonstration, would need more work to be rigorous, lacking in several areas
-most complicated bit of pipeline is the dataset handling
-the object detection is easy with SOTA models like YOLO and good quality datasets
-exercise in extracting the right dataset
-wanted to focus on nice user experience to simplify dataset creation from youtube videos
